List of Requirements with associated Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, there VNFs can be packaged as HEAT templates or in a CSAR file
using TOSCA.  At this stage, there are two different tools used for
validating the packages based on the package type:

* CSAR/TOSCA packages leverage VNFSDK
* HEAT packages leverage VVP

HEAT Package Validations
------------------------

This table shows all the requirements within the VNF Requirements project and
if they are validated by VVP.  If they are validated by VVP, then
the test module and test method is provided.  This is generated
dynamically within the VVP project, where it pulls down the latest JSON from
:doc:`Req List </../../../../vnfrqts/requirements.git/docs/Chapter9/index>`
and maps the requirements to the tests in VVP to output this table.

**Note: Tests on the bottom do not map to any requirements.**

**Note: VVP only validates Heat for Requirements in Chapter 5.**

for the current coverage for CSAR and TOSCA.
